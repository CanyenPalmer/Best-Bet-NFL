# Best-Bet-NFL

A Python service that evaluates NFL bets (props, spreads, totals, moneylines, team totals, parlays).

**What it returns**
- **Probability** (model-based, not odds-weighted)
- **Payout if win** (odds Ã— stake)
- **Expected value** (secondary)
- **Percent-focused summary** (rounded to 0.01%)

**What it supports**
- Player props (QB/RB/WR/K common lines)
- Moneyline, spreads, totals, team totals
- Parlays
- Batch processing: multiple singles + multiple parlays in one run

> NOTE: The engine ships with *stubbed math* so you can run and test right away. Swap in your model/ETL later by replacing `src/engine/nfl_bet_engine.py`.
